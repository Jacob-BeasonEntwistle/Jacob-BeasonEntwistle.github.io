        		<p class="viewport-text">I've already worked with Python, C#, Unity, Unreal Engine (Blueprints), and 3D modelling in Maya. I love building games, designing and implementing cool features, as well as creating assets. I'm especially passionate about coding and problem-solving, but I enjoy exploring all aspects of development.</p>

                <p class="viewport-text">I started coding in secondary school using Python and Scratch, and quickly became interested in how games are made. I played around in Unity (using C#) to create a game around June 2020, following tutorials and adding basic features like left/right movement and a way to respawn. During A-Levels, I built a 2D game in Unity with moving enemies, a health system, and my own custom sprites. I designed multiple levels, each with a different theme, and sprinkled collectables all throughout. Since starting my degree in Game Development Technology at BCU, I've worked with Unity, Unreal Engine, Maya, Python and many more tools. I will share some of my achievements and lessons learned throughout this website I made.</p>
